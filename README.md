📅 Day-22: Divide & Conquer in Java Programming Language
Welcome to Day 22 of my Data Structures & Algorithms journey!
In this module, I dive into the powerful Divide and Conquer paradigm — an essential strategy in solving complex problems efficiently by breaking them into smaller subproblems.

📘 What’s Covered?
✅ Core concept of Divide and Conquer
✅ Classic problems using this approach:

Binary Search (Recursive & Iterative)

Merge Sort

Quick Sort

Count Inversions in an Array

Majority Element (Moore's Voting + Divide & Conquer)

Power of a Number (Efficient Exponentiation)

Closest Pair of Points (Optional Advanced)

🧠 Key Takeaways
Efficient time complexity through problem decomposition

Mastery of recursion and base cases

Understanding how algorithms like merge sort use divide-merge strategy

Performance difference vs brute-force approaches

🚀 Why This Matters?
Divide & Conquer is a foundational concept for many advanced algorithms and competitive programming problems.
It boosts your logical thinking and recursion skills — and is a must-know for interviews and problem-solving.
